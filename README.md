# PhaserTests

1. Install ( Node + NPM ) https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install Gulp ( https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md ) 
The folder node_modules that will be created by step 2 is necesarry - add it to your git ignore and forget about it. Its the dependencies of gulp - and the dependencies of the dependencies. As a good friend of mine stated it: "Welcome to the web - where npm install the-whole internet" is the usual way to go.
